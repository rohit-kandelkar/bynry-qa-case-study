# My Approach

## Anti-Flakiness Strategy:  Explain that you used Web-First Assertions (expect) instead of static sleep commands to handle the dynamic loading of the SaaS dashboard.


## Page Object Model (POM): State that you chose POM to ensure that changes in the WorkFlow Pro UI only require updates in one file (pages/), not every test script.


## Hybrid Integration Testing: Explain the "Seed and Verify" approach: using API to create data (speed) and UI to verify visibility (accuracy).


## Security Focus: Note that "Tenant Isolation" is a primary test case to ensure data privacy between different B2B clients.
